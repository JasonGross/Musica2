  2005-01-23  bch :  Changed the content of Event's for channel-events from {type,{channel,data..}} to {{type,channel},{data..}}
                     Renamed keyword Duration to be TotalDuration and NoteDuration to Duration
                     Renamed keyword Type* to be ObjectType*
                     Renamed keyword Scale to be KeyMode
                     Renamed keyword Spectrum to be ToneSpectrum

  2004-09-16  bch :  This is a major rewrite. Started using up-values and a kind
                     of template for types. Not every feature from the previous
                     version is present, but this is so much better and will
                     give you a hint where Musica2 is going.
