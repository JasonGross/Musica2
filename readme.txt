Welcome to Musica2.

Musica is an open source project that aims at the creation of a complete Mathematica package for the exploration of the interconnection between Mathematics and Music.

History:

The original Musica was first created by Costis Merziotis and placed at Wolfram:
http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/4945/
After contacting Costis we decided to place Musica at SourceForge so that we could both contribute to it.
Being new to Mathematica I too often couldnt quite get Costis ideas, so when he got too busy at his daytime job and decided to hand Musica over to me I took the chance to make some changes.
Musica2 is an attempt to rewrite Musica into something that at least I find easier to use and understand.
While this might not be achieved I have left the original Musica untouched at SourceForge, both the original package and the CVS.

Download:

The latest packaged version can be downloaded at :
http://sourceforge.net/projects/musica/

but if You cant wait for the next package to be properly released You can always get the latest files from the CVS by these commands :
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/musica login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/musica co Musica2

or by pointing your browser to :
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/musica/Musica2/

Installation:

Im not sure how to do this on Windows, but on Linux I put a copy of the Musica2 folder from /Musica2.yyymmdd/Applications into the .Mathematica/Applications folder in my home-folder (actually I have a link pointing to the folder, not a copy).

Then You just have to do <<Musica2` inside Mathematica as expected.

Feedback:

Please give me feedback! This is the only way this package might get useful for You too.
You can mail me at bo@gcab.net, or You can attend to one of the forums at :
http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=90149

But most important, Have fun!
